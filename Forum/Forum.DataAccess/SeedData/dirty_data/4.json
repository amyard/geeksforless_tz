A company will promise to offer you a quality service, but you have to check and recheck those facts.</p><ul style=\"margin-right: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 2em; padding: 0px 0px 0.7em; position: relative;\">The company should work professionally. If you are hiring an individual designer, then check his/her professional qualification first. If you are hiring a designing company, check their past experiences and sample works. This will help you to determine the type of services they are going to offer you.</li><li style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 2em; padding: 0px 0px 0.7em; position: relative;\">A company must have an extensive knowledge about web designing.

So it's interesting to have a look at everyone's definitions for those mentioned titles here. And, I'd like to also add mine.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\"><strong>UI Designer (aka. User Interface Designer)</strong></p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">Well, the title literally says it all, this person designs user interface including any kind of visual layer that stands between the user and a product (mostly digital products). The required fundamental knowledge for this position involves understanding of how human use and communicate with (digital) products to create functional and easy to use interfaces combined with a sense of aesthetic.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\"><strong>UX Designer (aka. User Experience Designer)</strong></p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">Perhaps this is the most tricky one which makes it often hard to explain to a layman. A User Experience Designer is the one whose responsibility is to make sure that the overall experiences of the target users while and after using the product is positive and fit close to the target's demands. UX designers create mind maps, user journeys and real world usage scenarios to stimulate how would the target users use the product to create a solution which helps the users to accomplish their goals in the best possible way. Thus, their job is to make a lot of studied assumptions for which they design the solution to test and validate.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">One of the most important step of the user experience design process is to study the users whose experiences they're trying to design for. In order to do that, UX designers try to collect as information as possible about the target audiences by conducting interviews, making surveys, quantitative analysis etc. Collecting users data is an on-going process that never ends. UX designers collect and analyze the data constantly to create insights which will be the guideline for everyone else in not just the product team to make design and strategic product decision.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">User Experience Designer doesn't necessarily possess visual or graphic design skill set, however, an understanding of psychology and systematic design is a must.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\"><strong>Web Designer</strong></p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">UI designers who're specialized in design and building web user interface. Most of the web design jobs prefer the candidates who know a bit of front-end programming such as HTML/CSS, Javascript to show how the design/prototype would work on screen. The same preference also appears in most UX design job description.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\"><strong>Visual/Graphic Designer</strong></p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">This is basically graphic design or anything that needs a sense of aesthetic. Visual Designer's main job is to make thing look pretty and stylish. Most of the time, this position involves working with things that need to be printed out such as book covers, branding packages, billboards, etc. However, it's not just limited to print material, Visual Designer also creates beautiful digital websites, banners, infographics, etc. At the core, they're best at beautifying stuffs.</p>",

There're a lot of good answers here already, I just want to add one more perspective to the list.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">Sure, you can get a design job without having a degree or academic education. Same thing could be true for programming as well. You just need to show potential employers why and how you are qualified and suitable for the job, which could be done through doing lots of&nbsp; freelance works or working on your own projects.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">However, it's unlikely that you will be able to teach yourself probably if you choose this path. Because a design school may not teach you instantly applicable up-to-date techniques found on most Internet articles, the school will provide you basic knowledge and ground principles which is very important for beginners rather than some quick how-to-do tutorials. So you either have to be very good at self-learning or you need to find a good design mentor.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">I dropped out of college because I didn't get the value I want in academic environment. The first thing I did was putting my portfolio together, my resume was quite sufficient for jobs seeking thanked to a lot of freelance works I did during and before college time. I went on a job hunt and got some good offers but finally ended up working as an intern with no salary for a TV channel for kids &amp; teenagers. I decided to do so because I saw the opportunity for me to continue my education with the chief of design team in the channel. The chief was one of the best professionals of the design field in my city. It was working with him that I could grow myself to the best potential. We didn't talk a lot about techniques which you could find easily on the Internet, we often talked about theories, mindsets or how to put yourself in users/audience's shoes to practice user-centric design. All of those things are hard to find learn by yourself or it could take you a lot of times to figure it out on your own. That's why if you aren't into academic education - school or college, you should find yourself a good mentor somewhere to help you to grow fast and compensate for what you might be missing in school.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">Also, it's very important for you to learn how to networking and create connections, which is one of the big thing you might miss not going to school. So try to find yourself in some industrial communities and make new relationships, they will be very beneficial in the long run if you need helps or looking for freelance works. Get to know the best persons in the field and follow their works/blogs, it's never a waste to learn from others' experiences.</p>",

Then more depth and bevels and back again. Fashion is driven in circles by two things. The desire of the masses to look like the leaders, and the desire of the leaders to differentiate themselves from the masses. The pace of fashion accelerates, not with innovation, but as the masses get the means to more rapidly appropriate the status symbols of those they envy.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">The cycle accelerates until it implodes and spirals off in a different direction entirely. Flat design would have been PERFECT in the early, low bandwidth days of the web. But everyone then wanted to show depth and texture precisely because it was it was difficult to achieve. Once everyone could do it, it became fashionable not to - to show \"restraint\". When everyone one else had super flat mobile designs (pre-iPhone), Apple was showing off when they created a calendar that looked like bound leather. THE ONLY REASON THEY DID WAS TO SHOW OFF THE SCREEN RESOLUTION - i.e. BECAUSE THEY COULD. Other mobile interfaces were simple and flat out of necessity. Apple added texture because they could.

The bleeding edge is something that you live on. It's a place where group ideation turns interesting ideas into new concepts and the most common phrase is \"I think we're close\" - in a room with a century of combined professional experience. It gets written up when it works but the cutting room floor looks like a confetti factory.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; direction: ltr !important;\">Bleeding edge UX considers the page refresh a disruptive anti-pattern, for example.
