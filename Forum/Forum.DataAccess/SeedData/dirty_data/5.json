Let's put it this way: it is hard to finish a game, period. It is hard to start your project and somehow come up with the art and write all the code and actually finish it and get it up on the web or in an app store, etc. -- doing so is a real accomplishment if the game is at all non-trivial. Most teams never even make it to the point at which anything is playable much less polished and complete.</p><p class=\"ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start\" style=\"margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; margin-bottom: 0px !important; direction: ltr !important;\">Howevever, that said, all things being equal, in terms of paying one's bill&nbsp;<em>the above is far and a way the easy part</em>. Implementation is easy because one can do it if one knows how and one sets one's mind to it and powers through. You can't set your mind to and power through gaining users and getting money, however. If you could every decent programmer in the world would be supporting themselves by writing independent games.</p>",

The barrier to entry and the learning curve has dropped greatly at the bottom end.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\">At the other end of the scale, those engines plus myriad tools like PathEngine, ScaleForm, Havok, etc help folks get things done (not to say that AAA game projects have gotten cheaper or easier, they certainly haven't, but a great deal more can be achieved).</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\">The digital distribution thing may not technically be part of the \"development\" bit, but platforms like Steam (with its Early Access and Greenlight programs) and the huge rise of mobile app stores have greatly enhanced the scope of indie/low-budget game devs. Getting your stuff in reach of the average consumer is entirely doable nowadays (getting them to buy it is another story), as is making sure they have a reasonable chance of installing your latest patches and updates, and flogging them more content via DLC and in-app purchases. Years ago selling your games was a closed shop (ho ho) reserved for big publishers working through largely inaccessible retail markets.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\">Those same big publishers can also use Steam and app stores to push smaller products out faster, invest in more experimental things that would have been too risky before, avoid physical distribution hassles, keep everyone updated, sell DLC, manage piracy, etc.</span><br></p>",

Game programmers get to push technology to its absolute limits for the sheer purpose of spreading joy and blowing minds. A typical AAA game involves the implementation of physics, advanced mathematics, cutting edge graphics, artificial intelligence, networking techniques/algorithms (if it is a multiplayer game), and tons of other fascinating topics. When comparing this to your typical enterprise software, the latter can seem depressingly trivial and mundane.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\">Personally, the sweet spot for me is working in a software/web-dev job where I get to work on projects that interest me (though perhaps not as much as games interest me), make good money, and work reasonable hours. I still get to pursue my game dev interests and learn lots of cool things in my free time by working on my own indie game projects, but I also get to be comfortable and well-paid and not be exploited.</span><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><br style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;\">Fortunately for game developers, the impression I have is that their skillset is generally a superset of what is required to succeed in more generalized software development. Game developers not only have to have strong general programming/algorithmic skills, but also often need to have a very deep understanding in one or more specific aspects of game dev (such as graphics, AI, etc). So I imagine that a game developer who wants to transition to non-game development wouldn't have too much trouble.</span><br></p>",
